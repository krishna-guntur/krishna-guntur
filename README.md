👋 Hey, I’m Krishna

Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀

I’m an Application Developer currently working IBM with 5 years of IT experience. I’m passionate about Data, AI, and Problem-Solving, and I’m now on a mission to transition into AI/ML and advanced data engineering.

Currently, I’m pursuing my M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at BITS Pilani 🧑‍🎓, while continuously upskilling in Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

🎯 What I’m Working On Right Now

📊 Data Analysis with Python → Building strong foundations in NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn (and all that's relevant)

🧠 M.Tech → Deep dive into AI, ML, and Mathematical foundations

☁️ Cloud & Salesforce → Certified in AWS (Cloud Practitioner, Developer Associate), Azure Fundamentals, Salesforce Admin/Platform Developer 1

💼 Application Developer @ IBM → Handling Java/Spring Boot apps, Oracle DB, SQL, and application deployments in real-world enterprise systems

🛠️ Skills & Tools

    Programming → Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript with LWC, Apex

    Data Analysis & ML → NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
